For instance, in a look at a picture of a Mona Lisa or a fake Mona Lisa and determine that with 85% probability this isn't the real one, 0.85 fake. So in this case, it will be classified as fake and that information. And not just this fake information, but this 0.85 will be given to the generator to improve its efforts. In summary, the discriminator is a type of classifier that learns to model the probability of an example being real or fake given that set of input features, like RGB pixel values for images."
